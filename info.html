            <h1>Kathakali</h1>
            <p><img src="kathakali.jpg">Kathakali performance,like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music,
                vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas.
                However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements 
                from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South Indian.</p>
            <h1>Kathak</h1>
            <p><img src="kathak.jpg">The term Kathak is rooted in the Vedic term Katha  which means "story,
                 conversation, traditional tale". Kathak refers to one of the major classical dance
                  form primarily found in northern India, with a historical influence similar to Bharatanatyam
                   in south India, Odissi in east India and other major classical dances found in South Asia.
                    It differs from the numerous folk dance forms found in north and other parts of the Indian 
                    subcontinent.</p>
            <h1>Bharatnatyam</h1>
            <p><img src="bharanatyam.jpg">Bharatanatyam, (Tamil: பரத நாட்டியம்) also previously called Sadhir Attam,
                 is a major form of Indian classical dance that originated in Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam is one 
                 of the oldest classical dance traditions in India. It has been nurtured in the temples and courts 
                 of southern India since the ancient era. It is one of eight forms of dance recognized by 
                 the Sangeet Natak Akademi it expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, 
                  particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.</p>

        <p>The word "Dance" is very close to my heart.Just simply thinking or hearing this word
             it gives me something different feeling.I was always wanted to be a professional
              dancer but due to some reasons I can't be able to continue.But by fortune I found a golden opportunity 
              to develop a website on this and it feels so happy.Dance is not only a passion it is also a 
              medicine for me and it helps me in many ways physically as well as mentally.So KEEP DANCING.</p>
